//multiple processes = send results via pipes (bc processes dont share memory)
//need to:
    //make pipe for every child and fork
    //write child and parent processes
    //combine

//idea:
/*
parent --> fork child1 -> open/read file1 -> outputs wordcount to pipe & close file
       --> fork child1 -> open/read file2 -> outputs wordcount to pipe & close file
       --> fork child1 -> open/read file3 -> outputs wordcount to pipe & close file
       --> etc.. (for however many files)

    --> then parent takes all the children's outputs & merges pipes into one final result
